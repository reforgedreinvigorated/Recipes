        <h3 class = "ingredients">Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>1 lb ground beef, 85% lean</li>
            <li>½ lb ground pork</li>
            <li>3 garlic cloves, minced</li>
            <li>1 ¼ tsp salt</li>
            <li>1 tsp ground black pepper</li>
            <li>1 tsp paprika</li>
            <li>¾ tsp baking soda</li>

        <ol>
            <li>In a large bowl mix together all ingredients.</li>
            <li>Using slightly over 1 Tbsp of meat mixture per sausage, shape the mixture into sausages the size and shape of a fat finger (roughly 3 inches long and ¾ of an inch in diameter).</li>
            <li>Place all the formed sausages in a single layer on a platter. Cover the platter and refrigerate for at least 1 hour (up to overnight).</li>
            <li>When you are ready to cook your sausages, preheat your grill to medium heat, 350-400⁰F. (You should be able to hold your hand a few inches from the cooking grate for 5-7 seconds.)</li>
            <li>Grill the sausages using a fine grate grill pan for 4-5 minutes a side, until golden and springy.</li>
            <li>Serve the cevapi with sliced sweet onions and flatbread (like lepinja or pita). </li>
        </ol>
